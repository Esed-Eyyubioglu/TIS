## 💡 Reflection
The UTMDigital Open Day gave me real exposure to how **Technology and Information Systems** work in an actual organization. I learned how UTMDigital supports university operations through digital services such as infrastructure, system platforms, and secure service delivery. This visit helped me connect course concepts to real environments, making the learning more meaningful.

Overall, the activities were useful and increased my interest in ICT-related careers. The talks and staff interaction helped me understand the importance of IT professionals in keeping services reliable and secure. I believe visits like this improve student learning beyond the classroom and support better understanding of the subject.
